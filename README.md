Objective:
• To develop single-page e-wallet, specifically tailored for billing and bayad center functionalities, aiming to provide users with a streamlined online billing experience.
 
Scope:
• Concentrate on billing operations, encompassing utilities, subscriptions, and other related services.
• User can manage their billing account details
• Automatically generate and issue detailed receipts post-transaction.
 
Limitation:
• It will only focus on billing functionalities.
• Implementing robust security measures like two-factor authentication may be beyond the scope.
• The web app will operate independently, abstaining from integration with third-party payment gateways to ensure a direct and controlled billing process within the application.
